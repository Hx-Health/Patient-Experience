# Patient-Experience
A patient-facing app for managing medical records, diagnostic tests, and other health related data, aimed at giving patients control over their privacy and promote transparency in medicine. The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between patients and providers while allowing users to make their data work for them.

##Medical Data
Patients remain in complete control of data uploaded to the app. In addition, users can let their healthcare data work for themâ€”whether by directly monetizing their data, signing up for clinical research, or by connecting to other third-party services.

##Blockchain
A blockchain is in development for managing the transactional history of medical record transfers. Other healthcare related services such as prescription tracking, visit history, and clinical trial recruitment will be added as these services reach a point of adoption with blockchain technology. The blockchain network to back the Patient Experience app will come stock with a layer 2 off-chain protocol which utilizes a data-scrubbing tool to ensure that no PHI is ever uploaded onto the public blockchain, while still enabling certain demographic information to be verified without being tied back to a patient.
